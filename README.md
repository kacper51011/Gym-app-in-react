## General info

This is my react project, which is all about setting and storing your own workout plan. In this app you can:

- Create your own, editable list of workouts, with editable number of your own exercises(subpage: workouts).
- Look for exercises for every body part, also you will find how doing an exercise should look like by looking on gifs added to every exercise (subpage: exercises).
- After finding an interesting exercise, you can give it a star, then the exercise will be displayed in subpage named "favourites".
